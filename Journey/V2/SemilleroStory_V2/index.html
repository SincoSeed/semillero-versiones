        <p class="paragraph p1">At first it seemed unreal, that we, 3 mere apprentices would be given the opportunity to
            sit with our immediate bosses to talk and get to know each other before we started what would be a 6 month
            journey into SincoSoft.
            It definitely seemed a little abnormal and the three of us were visibly caught up in a whirlwind of mixed
            emotions,
            a mixture of nervousness, curiosity and happiness could be felt in the room as we sat there waiting for the
            last person participating in this meeting to connect through a video call....

        </p><img src="img/genius.png" class="align-left slide-in">
        <p class="paragraph p2">As the meeting went on, it was evident to us that these were not your typical office
            workers, these were masters at their craft. Their humility, transparency and sense of humor
            gave them a glowing a aura of confidence that was admirable.

        </p>
        <p class="paragraph p3"> ......After a bit of socializing and getting to know each other , we got down to the
            nitty gritty... <img src="img/omg.png" class="align-right slide-in">
            <br>
            <br>
            A proposition was finally given to us. We had to develop a dynamic web-page from scratch, and we had
            approximately one week to get it done!
            After some planning and figuring out what we would be capable of, (Not Much lol) we decided to go with HTML,
            CSS, PHP & MySQL. We chose these languages because we needed to get a 'CRUD' done and the only sure and fast
            way we knew how to do this was using a 'WAMP' package.</p>
        <img src="img/wamp.jpg" class="align-right slide-in">
        <p class="paragraph p4">..Due to company security policies, it took about 3 days to finally get WAMP installed
            and running. Now we had only 3 days to finish! <img src="img/scared.png" class="align-center slide-in">
            Needless to say we where in a race against time to finish our first project</p>
        <img src="img/meeting.jpg" class="align-right slide-in">


        <p class="paragraph p5"> We gathered our thoughts and began using tools presented to us. A morning meeting to
            determine what we had accomplished the day before, what we needed to accomplish and what was most important
            at the moment became a routine that kept us going steady.
            Unbeknownst to us, this was something our mentors called a 'Daily'. Dailies were intended to be instilled in
            us as a group. We were also encouraged to do extensive research on even the most seemingly diminutive
            topics. This eventually proved to be crucial in understanding more complex topics.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph p6"> After what seemed like forever our Web-Page began to finally take shape!
            <img src="img/1.png" class="align-right slide-in">
            <br>
            <br>
            Looking back now, it was a terrible shape!! <img src="img/laugh.png" class="align-center slide-in"> I
            mean, who in their right mind would use a sky blue background with tiny green and black letters!</p>
        <img src="img/2.png" class="align-left slide-in">

        <p class="paragraph p7">..In retrospect, I believe that you can actually <img src="img/leaf.jpg"
                class="align-right slide-in"> measure the quantity of what we've learned by looking at the different
            phases of our Web-Pages, which till this day continue to evolve with us. Like leafs on a plant that blossoms
            along with it, demonstrating its constant growth...

            <br>
            <br>

            Our project presentation day arrived.... and this is what we had.</p>
        <img src="img/3.png" class="align-right slide-in">
        <p class="paragraph p8">The Web-Page allowed you to insert new topic with name, a description and chapter.
            Depending on the chapter
            you assigned to it, the new topic would be organized on both the web-page and the database connected to it.
            Likewise you had options to delete or edit the topics and any alteration would also be seen affected in the
            database.
        </p>




        <p class="paragraph p9">....That day we were given the worst rating possible "4% out of 100%"<iframe

                class="align-right slide-in"></iframe>
            As we went through our Web-Page we found so many bugs and mistakes! Some of which we had no idea
            existed. These guys were expert code analyzers taking our project apart like an appetizer before dinner
            <img src="img/4.png" class="align-left slide-in">
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s been 3 months since that day and what we have now is the accumulative results of
            sitting in front of a computer everyday with the simple objective of learning as much as possible before the
            day ends
        </p>
        <img src="img/5.png" class="align-right slide-in">

        <p class="paragraph p10"> As apprentices in a field so vast in possibilities and intricate methods of efficacy,
            we
            know that there is a long way to go.<img src="img/pro.png" class="align-left slide-in"> There is so much
            to learn and apply. We understand that feedback, constructive criticism and guidance will take us farther in
            our careers.This is why we have so many questions for Software Developers here at SincoSoft and we will
            always be open to hear any observations and opinions.
