            At first it seemed unreal, that we, 3 mere apprentices would be given the oportunity to sit with our
            immideate bosses to talk and get to know eachother before we started what would be a 6 month journey into
            SincoSoft,
            it defenetly seemed a little abnormal and the three of us were visibly caught up in a whorlwind of mixed
            emotions,
            a mixture of nervousness, curiosity and happiness could be felt in the room as we sat there waiting for the
            last of the persom participating in this meeting to connect through a video call.
        </p><img src="../img/genius.png" class="align-left slide-in">
        <p>As the meeting went on it was evident to us that these were not your tipical office workers, these where
            masters at their craft. Their humility, transparency and sence of humor
            gave them a glowing a aura of confidence that was admirable.
        </p>
        <p>......After a bit of socialising and getting to know eachother , we got down to the nitty gritty...</p> <img
            src="../img/omg.png" class="align-right slide-in">
        <p>A proposition was finally given to us. We had to develope a dynamic web-page from scratch, and we had
            approximately one week to get it done! </p>
        <p>After a bit of planning and figureing out what we would be capable of we decided to go with HTML, CSS, PHP &
            MySQL. We chose these lenguajes because we needed to get a 'CRUD' done and the only sure and fast way we
            knew how to do this was usuing a 'WAMP' package.</p>
        <img src="../img/wamp.jpg" class="align-right slide-in">
        <p>..Due to company policies it took about 3 days to finally get WAMP installed and running. Now we had only 3
            days to finish! <img src="../img/scared.png" class="align-center slide-in"> Needless to say we where in a
            race against time to finish our first project</p>
        <img src="../img/meeting.jpg" class="align-right slide-in">


        <p> We gathered our thoughts and began using tools presented to us. A morning meeting to determine what we had
            accomplised the day before, what we needed to accomplish and what was most important at the moment became a
            routine that kept us going steady.
            Unbeknownst to us, this was something our mentors called a 'daily'. Daylies were intended to be instilled in
            us as a group. We were also encouraged to do extensive research on even the most seemingly diminutive topics
            which eventually proved crucial to understanding more complex topics.
        </p>

        <p> After what seemed like forever our Web-Page began to take shape! </p>
        <img src="../img/1.png" class="align-right slide-in">

        <p> Looking back now it was a terrible shape! <img src="../img/laugh.png" class="align-center slide-in"></p>
        <img src="../img/2.png" class="align-left slide-in">

        <p>In retrospect, I believe that you could actually <img src="../img/leaf.jpg" class="align-right slide-in">
            mesure the quantity of what we've learned by looking at the different phases of our Web-Pages, which till
            this day continue to evolve with us. Like leafs on a plant that blossums along with it, demonstrating it's
            constant growth</p>



        <p> Our project presentation day arrived.... and this is what we had.</p>
        <img src="../img/3.png" class="align-right slide-in">
        <p>the Web-Page allowed you to insert a new topic with name a description and chapter. Depending on the chapter
            you assigned to it, the new topic would be organized on both the web-page and the a database connected to
            it. like wise you had options to delete or edit the topics and any alteration would also be seen affected in
            the database.
